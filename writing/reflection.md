# Reflection by Janyl Jumadinova

Copied from the README.md: This assignment requires a programmer to implement
and test a Java program, called `DisplayOutput`, that will produce four lines
of output. The first line of output will contain the name of the programmer and
the date at which the program was run. The next three lines of output will
feature any one-sentence and one-line statements of advice that the programmer
would like to provide to the person using the program. The source code for the
`DisplayOutput` program must adhere to all of the requirements in the [Google
Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
